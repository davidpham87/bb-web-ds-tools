## 2025-12-24 - [CSV Formula Injection Protection]
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data exported to CSV/TSV could contain formulas (starting with =, +, -, @) that execute when opened in Excel/Google Sheets.
**Learning:** Standard regex matching (`re-matches .*`) in ClojureScript/JS does not match newlines by default, allowing bypass via multiline strings.
**Prevention:** Use `re-find` with start-of-string anchor (`^...`) instead of `re-matches` with `.*`, or enable dot-all mode if full matching is required.

## 2026-01-31 - [State Injection via URL]
**Vulnerability:** The `::load-shared-state` event blindly merged decoded JSON from the URL query parameter `?state=` into the application database (`app-db`), allowing attackers to overwrite sensitive keys like `[:platform]` or `[:runtime]`.
**Learning:** Functions that hydrate application state from untrusted sources (like URL parameters) must explicitly whitelist allowed keys rather than using `merge`.
**Prevention:** Replaced `(merge db decoded)` with `(merge db (select-keys decoded [:user-input]))`.
