## 2025-05-22 - Content Security Policy
**Vulnerability:** Missing CSP allowed potential XSS/injection attacks.
**Learning:** For this project,  is the source of truth, not a build artifact.
**Prevention:** CSP added with strict allow-list for CDNs (Tailwind, WebR, Pyodide).

## 2025-12-24 - [CSV Formula Injection Protection]
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data exported to CSV/TSV could contain formulas (starting with =, +, -, @) that execute when opened in Excel/Google Sheets.
**Learning:** Standard regex matching (`re-matches .*`) in ClojureScript/JS does not match newlines by default, allowing bypass via multiline strings.
**Prevention:** Use `re-find` with start-of-string anchor (`^...`) instead of `re-matches` with `.*`, or enable dot-all mode if full matching is required.

## 2026-01-20 - [SQL Injection in Persistence Layer]
**Vulnerability:** Manual string concatenation was used to construct SQL INSERT statements for SQLite WASM, relying on simple quote replacement which is error-prone and insecure.
**Learning:** Even in client-side SQL (sqlite-wasm), parameterized queries (binding) must be used to ensure data safety and correctness, especially when handling complex user input.
**Prevention:** Use `sqlite3.exec({sql: "...", bind: [...]})` instead of string interpolation.
