## 2025-05-22 - Content Security Policy
**Vulnerability:** Missing CSP allowed potential XSS/injection attacks.
**Learning:** For this project,  is the source of truth, not a build artifact.
**Prevention:** CSP added with strict allow-list for CDNs (Tailwind, WebR, Pyodide).

## 2025-12-24 - [CSV Formula Injection Protection]
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data exported to CSV/TSV could contain formulas (starting with =, +, -, @) that execute when opened in Excel/Google Sheets.
**Learning:** Standard regex matching (`re-matches .*`) in ClojureScript/JS does not match newlines by default, allowing bypass via multiline strings.
**Prevention:** Use `re-find` with start-of-string anchor (`^...`) instead of `re-matches` with `.*`, or enable dot-all mode if full matching is required.

## 2026-01-22 - [HoneySQL RCE via Unsafe Eval]
**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) in HoneySQL conversion tool due to usage of `sci/eval-string` on user input instead of a safe reader.
**Learning:** `sci/eval-string` executes code, which is dangerous for data processing. Confusion between "parsing EDN" and "evaluating Clojure" led to this.
**Prevention:** Use `clojure.edn/read-string` (or `cljs.reader/read-string`) when parsing trusted or untrusted data structures. Never use `eval` unless code execution is the explicit feature.
